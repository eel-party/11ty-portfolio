Lee has been making art in various formats for basically his entire life-- some of his earliest recollections revolve around drawing and making paper cuts outs of characters as new friends for his Ninja Turtles and Barbie dolls. 

After a multi-year stretch focusing primarily on digital art (and at least one attempt to "quit" art completely), Lee has returned to the analog art world with a new-found enthusiasm for creating tangible things. 

His work currently focuses on themes of transformation, repetition, and the search for meaning in the absurd landscape of dreams.
