Lee has been making art in various formats for basically his entire life&mdash;some of his earliest recollections revolve around drawing and making paper cuts outs of characters as new friends for his Ninja Turtles and Barbie dolls. 

After a multi-year stretch focusing primarily on digital art (and at least one attempt to "quit" art completely), Lee has returned to the analog art world with a new-found enthusiasm for creating tangible things. 

His work currently focuses on themes of transformation, repetition, and the search for meaning in the absurd landscape of dreams. He is also deeply influenced by his experience as a trans person.
