From the promotional blurb:

> " PARTS INSIDE " is Lee Ely's first solo show, featuring all new work. Lee is a mixed media artist with a focus on themes of transformation, repetition, and the search for meaning in the absurd landscape of dreams.

These paintings were created over the space of 5 weeks.

Acrylic and paint marker on wood blocks and cardboard.
