From the artist's statement:

> “Sleep Debtor” is a collection of paintings rooted in the half-awake world of the perpetually weary.
Lee is a mixed-media artist with a focus on themes of transformation, repetition, and the search for meaning in the absurd landscape of dreams.

These paintings were created in December 2019.

Acrylic and paint marker on wood blocks, 11 x 14".

Sleep Debtor opened on January 10, 2020, at Stumptown Coffee Roasters. All work will be on display until April 3, 2020.
